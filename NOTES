= Refcount =

* Alloc with malloc, free with free.
* Every object has a refcount field.
* This field is first, so we can access
  it through a generic struct.
* We can allocate objects and increment
  their refcount knowing only their size.
* To deallocate objects, each needs its
  own "destroy" function in order to
  handle recursive deallocation.

= GC =

* Alloc with malloc, free never.
* Can leave out basically everything
  that's specific to refcounting.
* Need to watch for non-trivial destroy
  functions in case we need finalizers.
